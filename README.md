# Clean Code - A Primer
These are the source files for my tech talk "Clean Code: A Primer on Writing Maintainable Software."

For anyone who wants to apply the techniques discussed in the presentation, clone this repository and work from the solution in the  **1_CartoonParserBefore** folder.

The **2_CartoonParserAfter** folder contains the changes I made as an example of ways to apply Clean Code. It is designed so that the commit history shows and explains each concept. View the commit history and annotations to see why I made the decisions I made.
